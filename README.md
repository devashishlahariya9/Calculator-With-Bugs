# Calculator-With-Bugs

A Basic Calculator App made using .NET WPF Framework By Microsoft. As the name suggests tha app has several bugs in it. I made this during my vacations for fun. The app for a basic calculator is unnecessarily large in size.

It can perform basic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication & Division.
